# CAD and Other Mechanical Design Files for the Obedience Box Hardware

## Current state:
- CADQuery code is started
- Most basic elements are accounted for, a few big features are completely missing still
- All details are missing, exact locations, hole sizes, font and font size, etc are all rough estimates
- Most of the details can be plugged into the `config.py` file once we know exact measurements
- The horizontal lines are not right, we should probably define start and end points for them instead of just a center and length
