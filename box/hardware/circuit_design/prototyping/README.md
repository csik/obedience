# Breakout Boards for Prototyping and Testing Functionality of the User Interface

## The Obedience Box User Interface consists of three main components:
- 30 switches
- 30 LEDs
- An analog voltmeter

## This directory contains small breakout boards used to test out these systems

### Each subdirectory has all the files needed to:
- edit the schematic and pcb layout using KiCad 6
- construct the board (pdf schematic, BOM, gerbers)
- test the board with a python script

### In the testing phase, upload and run the python test script on a Raspberry Pi with wires connected to the breakout boards as needed

### Expect these boards to be a work in progress as we hone in on the final circuit design

### See the individual breakout board directories for further information
