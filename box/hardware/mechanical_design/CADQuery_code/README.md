## CADQuery 2 code for creating the front panel

### Prerequisites:
- Create/activate a conda environment for CADQuery projects
- Install the CADQuery 2 library

### Recommended:
- It is convenient to install CQ-editor for viewing the panel as you work
- Use an external code editor of your choice to write the code, and only use CQ-editor to view your work
- CQ-editor Edit -> Preferences -> Autoreload allows you to render the changes whenever you hit save in your text editor

### Status:
- The general scaffolding for the code is in place, but incomplete
- All measurements are rough guesses until we learn the accurate dimensions
- Some components are simplified placeholders, such as the voltage meter and multi-turn pots
- Not all text and graphical lines are included yet
